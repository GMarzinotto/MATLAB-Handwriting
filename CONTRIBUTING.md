# Contributing

We welcome all contributions, I have some ideas in mind that could improve:

* Documentation for some funtionalities is incomplete and in some cases it may be outdated
* Handwriting animations do not support color scaling, and it could be fairly easy to implement
* Improving word segmentation may be interesting
* I would consider nice to have this toolbox in a python package.
* Implementing a baseline handwriting recognition system would also be an interesting contribution.

In order to contribute please keep in mind the following guidelines:

* For large changes please discuss them in an issue first.
* Use feature branches for your changes.
* For each funtionality consider including a Demo example.
* Please ensure that your commit does not affect previous Demo examples
